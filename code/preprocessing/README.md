## Preprocessing

Scripts in this directory perform basic preprocessing and aggregation
of articulatory measurements extracted from MRI frames.

These steps include:
- Coordinate normalization relative to a head reference
- Aggregation of frame-level measurements within vowel categories

The scripts generate summary statistics reported in Table 1.
