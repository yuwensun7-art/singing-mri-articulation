# Singing MRI Articulation

This repository contains analysis code and derived data representations associated with a study on articulatory coordination in singing based on real-time MRI.

## Repository structure

- `code/`  
  Scripts for preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, acoustic analysis, and inverse feasibility analysis.

- `data/`  
  Documentation of source materials and derived representations.

- `figures/`  
  Figures generated for the manuscript.

## Source MRI material

The real-time MRI recordings analyzed in this study originate from publicly available video material hosted on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REHXN-idz-I

These recordings are not owned by the author and are therefore **not redistributed** in this repository.

Image frames used for analysis were obtained via screen recording and subsequent cropping for research purposes only. In accordance with copyright restrictions, no video files or image frames derived from the source material are shared here. This repository provides only the analysis code and illustrative examples necessary to reproduce the computational workflow.
